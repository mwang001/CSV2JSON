Perseverance, nicknamed Percy,[2] is a car-sized Mars rover designed to explore the Jezero crater on Mars as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission. It was manufactured by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched on July 30, 2020, at 11:50 UTC.[3] Confirmation that the rover successfully landed on Mars was received on February 18, 2021, at 20:55 UTC.[4][5] As of 4 January 2023, Perseverance has been active on Mars for 666 sols (685 Earth days, or 1 year, 10 months and 17 days) since its landing. Following the rover's arrival, NASA named the landing site Octavia E. Butler Landing.[6][7]

Perseverance has a similar design to its predecessor rover, Curiosity, although it was moderately upgraded. It carries seven primary payload instruments, nineteen cameras, and two microphones.[8]

The rover also carried the mini-helicopter Ingenuity to Mars, an experimental aircraft and technology testbed that made the first powered flight on another planet on April 19, 2021.[9] As of December 22, 2022, it has made 37 successful flights.[10][11][12] Ingenuity's 25th successful flight, which occurred on April 8, 2022, saw the helicopter set new records for highest speed and distance traveled during a single flight.[13]

The rover's goals include identifying ancient Martian environments capable of supporting life, seeking out evidence of former microbial life existing in those environments, collecting rock and soil samples to store on the Martian surface, and testing oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere to prepare for future crewed missions.[14]
